Interfacing gives your material rigidity, and ensures the proper formation of embroidery stitches.

Cut the interfacing to be larger than both your design and the hoop you intend to use.</p> <p>The hoop is the tool used to secure your workpiece in the embroidery machine. It is removable from the machine and indexes, meaning it is safe to remove and re-install the hoop mid-job without losing position. The E16 uses 2 different styles of hoops; magnetic and screw-lock.</p> <p>Magnetic hoops are generally square and are made of distinct white and blue plastic. These are comprised of two parts that secure together with extremely strong magnets. Simply separate the two parts, pull your material taught between them, and the let the magnets re-attach. The upper hoop, the one with the metal arms, should be on top.</p> <p>The magnets are keyed, and will only go together one way. We recommend closing one side of the magnets first, then pulling the material as you let the other 3 connect. </p> <p></p> <p>Danger</p> <p>The magnets on these hoops are EXTREMELY STRONG and snap back together with violent force! Keep fingers clear as you close them, and use only designated manipulation dogs on the hoop to grab by.</p> <p></p> <p>Screw-Lock hoops are generally used on smaller designs. They are comprised of a bottom ring with a screw on it, and a top hoop with a matching ring shape.
