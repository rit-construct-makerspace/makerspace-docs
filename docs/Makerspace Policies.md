The following policies apply to all users of all makerspaces, including the facilities themselves and all materials, equipment, tools, and similar contained within, at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). 

## Permitted Users

The makerspaces are solely for use by;

* Active Students, as defined by [RIT Policy D02.0 Section III](https://www.rit.edu/policies/d020)
* Regular Faculty, Regular Staff, or Adjuncts, as defined by [RIT Policy E01.0 Section II](https://www.rit.edu/policies/e010)

Makerspace staff, at their discretion for any reason that is not in violation of RIT Policy, may temporarily or permanently restrict a Permitted User from entering, accessing, or otherwise using the makerspace.

These persons permitted to use the makerspaces are henceforth referred to as "makers". 

## Permitted Project Classifications

All work completed in the makerspace is considered to be part of or towards the completion of a "project". The makerspace is permitted to be used for only certain classifications of projects, as listed below;

* **Personal**: These are projects defined as being primarily for the benefit of the maker outside of any academic, commercial, or similar organization, function, event, or similar, completed primarily for personal non-monetary gain, pleasure, learning, or otherwise fulfillment. This includes, but is not limited to, exercise of a hobby or interest, creation of art or other similar expressive works for personal display or consumption, and creation of an item for personal use or to be given as a gift as considered by US Law.

This can include projects to be sold for fundraising efforts that provide funding specifically for the operation of the club, organization, or similar in a way that benefits students.

* **Entrepreneurial**: These are projects defined as being for the benefit of an independent, private, for-profit business. Such projects are only permitted if the business is in part or fully owned by a [maker](#permitted-users) or being developed by a [maker](#permitted-users) through an RIT-sponsored or RIT-affiliated business accelerator, incubator, or similar, and the project is for the development of the business, not for immediate sale, use in the creation of an item or service for sale, or for other commercial benefit. Some examples of permitted entrepreneurial projects are developing and manufacturing prototypes, creating end-use devices for user testing, etc.
