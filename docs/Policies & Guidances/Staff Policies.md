# Staff Policies

The following document describes policies and expectations of staff of the makerspace. 

For the purposes of this document, staff are defined as student employees, employed by the RIT makerspaces in an official capacity to supervise, assist, oversee, or otherwise manage the use of the makerspace, including the facility itself as well as the equipment, tools, resources, materials, consumables, etc. contained within. 

## Duty to Act

Makerspace staff, when on duty or on shift and in their assigned spaces, are expected to act in accordance with all policies found in this document.

Staff, when present in their assigned spaces but not on duty, are empowered to act solely to address imminent health and safety concerns, at their discretion.

## Responsibilities

### Staff Competency

Staff are expected, within one month of their hiring or assignment to a space, whichever is first, to be competent in the safe and proper use of all equipment within their assigned, except for so-designated "complex equipment" for which training and operation is generally overseen by specialized staff.

Staff may use their time on shift to develop and maintain their competency with equipment, in accordance with [On Shift Permitted Personal Actions](#on-shift-permitted-personal-actions).

### On Shift Permitted Personal Actions

While on shift, staff are not permitted to work on homework, course work, club projects, or any other assigned or volunteered work for any entity other than the makerspace.

Staff can work on personal projects that utilize makerspace resources, either for a permitted project type or for personal competency development, so long as it does not interfere with the ability to properly supervise the shop. For instance, if there are other staff on shift or there is no other makers in the space and you can see the front desk at all times. Working on personal projects should be the lowest priority of staff, and only done if there is no other work to complete in the space.

### Atrium Makerspace Mentors

Staff are to be processing the 3DPrinterOS queues in a timely manner. Those that have been trained in SLA or SLS are to be checking in and processing those queues.

When filling coolant in any of the equipment that requires it, you are to mix the coolant with water at a 1 part coolant to 10 parts water ratio.

### General Makerspace Mentors

Staff are required to process the 3DPrinterOS queue in a timely manner. Print beds are to be physically checked prior to starting a print, free and clear of debris. Printers should be checked on in 5-10 minute intervals to make sure nothing is going awry.

When people are operating the lasers, Staff are to be checking in on the cut, especially long-running cuts, to make sure there is no damage being caused to the material or equipment.

## Staff Privileges

Staff have no privileges beyond a normal maker when using the makerspaces not in their capacity as a staff, except for the following;

* Staff may access some 3D printing and other paid consumables at a discounted rate
* Staff may use the makerspace(s) they are assigned to outside of open hours, if they are accompanied by at least one other maker to act as a buddy. This access us only permitted within the building's hours, if the makerspace is in a building that is not open 24/7. 

Staff may not use their elevated permissions or access to internal systems as a way to gain access to equipment or resources without going through the normal training procedures.

Staff, when using the makerspace resources and equipment, are beholden to all applicable policies and guidelines that would apply to non-staff makers. 

## Emergency Response

In the event of an emergency situation, staff are expected to act in the following capacities;

### Fire

When a fire, whether in the space, in the building, or a drill/false-alarm, occurs, staff are expected to do the following;

* If the fire is visible and the fire alarm has not been activated yet, it is the responsibility of the staff to activate the fire alarm and follow the posted routes to exit the building as soon as possible.

### Injury

If an injury occurs with a maker, follow the emergency response boards on the walls posted in each area. Depending on the severity, Public Safety is to be notified (*anything more than a papercut*), as well as an incident report is to be filled out within 24 hours of the incident.

## Staff Self-Checkout

Staff are restricted from processing payments, including paying owed debts and paying for products or services of the makerspace while on shift. Furthermore, they are not permitted to use their access to such payment systems to process payments for themselves, friends, immediate family, or members of the same club, group, or organization.

## Further Staff Policies

In addition to, but not superseding the above, staff are expected to abide by the employment policies of their specific departments and/or business units, as provided during employment.
