These persons permitted to use the makerspaces are henceforth referred to as "makers". 

## Permitted Project Classifications

All work completed in the makerspace is considered to be part of or towards the completion of a "project". The makerspace is permitted to be used for only certain classifications of projects, as listed below;

* **Personal**: These are projects defined as being primarily for the benefit of the maker outside of any academic, commercial, or similar organization, function, event, or similar, completed primarily for personal non-monetary gain, pleasure, learning, or otherwise fulfillment. This includes, but is not limited to, exercise of a hobby or interest, creation of art or other similar expressive works for personal display or consumption, and creation of an item for personal use or to be given as a gift as considered by US Law.

* **Academic**: These are projects defined as being necessary or immediately relevant for the execution and/or completion of academic work as assigned by RIT faculty for an RIT class or other academic function.

* **Research**: These are projects defined as being for the execution of RIT-affiliated research work, being primarily conducted by RIT students, faculty, and/or staff in the service of RIT, and/or primarily being conducted in RIT-owned or RIT-sponsored facilities.

* **Club**: These are projects defined as being for the benefit of or as part of the actions of an official club, union, association, or similar student organization recognized by the RIT Center for Campus Life. This can include projects to be sold for fundraising efforts that provide funding specifically for the operation of the club, organization, or similar in a way that benefits students.

* **Entrepreneurial**: These are projects defined as being for the benefit of an independent, private, for-profit business. Such projects are only permitted if the business is in part or fully owned by a [maker](#permitted-users) or being developed by a [maker](#permitted-users) through an RIT-sponsored or RIT-affiliated business accelerator, incubator, or similar. The project must be for the development of the business, not for immediate sale, use in the creation of an item or service for sale, or for other commercial benefit. Some examples of permitted entrepreneurial projects are developing and manufacturing prototypes, creating end-use devices for user testing, etc.

This includes, but is not limited to, the design and/or fabrication of such objects, precursors to such objects, or accessories and/or add-ons to such objects, functional or otherwise. This restriction also extends to depictions, representations, models and/or other non-functional or limited-functionality objects intended to resemble or mimic a weapon, firearm, or dangerous instrument that may be interpreted as or mistaken for a weapon, firearm, or dangerous instrument.

* **Violation of RIT Policy**: Any project that results in violation of RIT Policy, either in the process of working on the project or with the end-result of the project, is not permitted.

* **Projects Forbidden by Staff**: The staff of the makerspace, at their discretion, may forbid any project from the makerspace for any reason that is not in violation of RIT Policy.

If found in the makerspace, such restricted project types may be confiscated at the discretion of makerspace staff.

## Intellectual Property & Sensitive Data

All work conducted in the makerspace falls under the RIT Intellectual Property Policy (C03.0), which can be found [here](https://www.rit.edu/policies/c030).

The open and public-facing nature of the makerspace does not make it a suitable environment for sensitive information. As such, the makerspace does not permit work on projects that may involve information deemed sensitive, confidential, or secret by university policy and/or applicable laws. Projects worked on in the makerspace, including data accessed on makerspace computers and other electronic equipment, should be considered to be publicly visible and it is the duty of the maker to take appropriate actions regarding their data.

Information collected by the makerspace for the purpose of identifying makers is handled in compliance with university policies, including but not limited to [C08.1 Information Security Policy.](https://www.rit.edu/policies/c081).

## Alcohol, Drugs, Medication, and Other Mind-Altering Substances

No person may enter or use the makerspace if they are under the influence of alcohol, drugs, and/or other mind-altering substances. 

Makers who are taking or have recently taken prescription medication should consult their prescribing healthcare practitioner to determine if it is safe and proper for them to be near and/or operating the equipment found in the makerspace.

## Dress Standards

No person may enter any makerspace if the clothing they are wearing does not satisfy the following criteria;

* **Closed-Toe Shoes**: All persons must wear footwear that properly and fully covers the entirety of their foot/feet, including but not limited to the sole, instep, and toes.

* **Bags**: Backpacks, purses, fanny packs, and other similar carrying containers must be removed and stored away from any rotating, spinning, or moving equipment.

Furthermore, specific areas, zones, rooms, or similar of the makerspace may have more stringent requirements. Such requirements are posted prominently on signs, placards, or electric displays at or near the entrance to such spaces, and makers must ensure their compliance with such requirements before entering.

While in any makerspace, no person may add, remove, or otherwise change the clothing they are wearing in such a way that it is in violation of the above standards.

Policies regarding dress standards are superseded by [Personal Protective Equipment](#personal-protective-equipment) requirements where necessary and applicable for compliance with safety mandates.

## Personal Protective Equipment

It is the responsibility of makers to understand the required Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for operating or being within proximity of a tool, space, piece of equipment, or similar. Any such PPE required is provided at no expense by the makerspace to all makers. Re-usable PPE, such as glasses and helmets, are provided in spaces and areas where they are required. Such PPE is expected to be returned in a clean and functional state upon exiting that space or area.

### Equipment Damage

It is understood and expected for equipment, tools, resources, and similar to be damaged as part of their regular use. Any damage must be reported to staff immediately upon discovery. 

If damage to makerspace equipment, tools, resources, or similar was found to be due to disregard for safety policies, improper use, or otherwise negligent actions, the offending maker may face [Disciplinary Action](#disciplinary-action).

## Equipment Access Control Systems

Attempting to interfere with, defeat, bypass, or otherwise gain access to a piece of equipment with an access control system, including physical lockouts, is not permitted.

Some equipment in some makerspaces has restricted access through the use of a card-based Access Control System. Use of such equipment with anything other than your current, valid, university-issued ID or current, valid, makerspace-issued ID is not permitted. This includes emulation, cloning, or otherwise mimicking the identifying information of your issued ID card with another device or card.

## Free Consumables

The makerspaces offer many consumable components and resources for free for makers. Abuse of these free consumables, such as over-use or taking more than reasonably needed, is not permitted. Such abuse will be determined at the sole discretion of staff. Users found to be abusing free consumables may no longer be permitted to use such consumables and/or be asked to replace what they have taken.

## Project Storage

For the convenience of makers, some makerspaces have designated areas for temporary storage of projects. This storage is meant for in-progress projects that are actively being worked on, on a regular basis. Projects stored in these areas must comply with the following requirements;

* The entirety of the project must fit within the provided storage receptacle for that makerspace, and/or the permitted footprint of stored projects for that storage area.

* Projects cannot be stored for more than 7 continuous calendar days.
* All major components of the project must be prominently labeled with the owner's RIT email address.

Projects stored in violation of any of the above requirements will immediately be considered [Abandoned Property](#abandoned-property).

The ability to store your project in the makerspace is not a guarantee, and is at the discretion of the staff.

The makerspace reserves the right to terminate storage of a project at any time for any reason. In such a situation the maker will be notified of this decision by email, and the maker will have 24 hours to remove their property from the makerspace before it is considered [Abandoned Property](#abandoned-property).

The makerspace makes no guarantee regarding the safety or security of projects left in the space, including objects left in designated project storage areas.

## Abandoned Property

Property is considered abandoned if it has been left in a makerspace outside of a designated [Project Storage space](#project-storage) after the person(s) who brought it into the makerspace have left, or is stored in Project Storage in violation of the Project Storage requirements.

Abandoned property may be moved to a different area of the makerspace, removed from the makerspace to a designated lost & found location on campus, or disposed of in accordance with applicable laws. Makers may he charged the reasonable cost associated with the removal and proper disposal of abandoned property. 

The makerspace assumes no liability for damage, theft, or loss of abandoned property.

## Project Losses and Damage

While the makerspace makes every effort to ensure equipment, tools, resources, etc. are in good and working order, the makerspace assumes no liability for damages to property that result from use of said property in a project at the makerspace.

## Access to Spaces

All makerspaces are available to all [makers](#permitted-users) when designated as open by staff. The official open hours the makerspaces can be found at [make.rit.edu](https://make.rit.edu), but it is at the discretion of staff in that moment if a makerspace is opened or closed.

Makerspaces are closed in observance of university holidays, snow days, and other such events that result in a university closure.

Upon a makerspace closing for whatever reason, makers are expected to promptly exit the space ensuring it is neat and orderly.

If a maker ever finds a makerspace accessible without staff present, they are required to promptly notify RIT Public Safety.

### Makerspace Events

Sometimes, events occur in or near the makerspace that necessitate its closure for general use. During such events, only those with authorization to be present as part of the event may use the makerspace. The makerspace will make every effort to notify makers ahead of time of such events via the website, make.rit.edu. 

### After-Hours Access

Some persons, as part of their association with an event, project, group, or otherwise, have select after-hours access to select areas of some makerspaces. This is defined as having the ability and authority to use a makerspace outside of the regularly posted hours and without staff present. Such persons are able to access the makerspace via the university's access control keycard system, henceforth referred to as "swipe". 

All makerspace policies remain in effect during after-hours access. 

Persons with swipe to a makerspace may allow other [makers](#permitted-users) entrance into the space, and take full personal responsibility for the actions of these makers. This includes ensuring compliance with makerspace policies. Persons with after-hours access are not expected to open the makerspace for all makers, and may be selective in who they allow into the space. All other makers must leave the space before the person with swipe does. It is the responsibility of the person with swipe to ensure the space is secured properly before departing, including removing all other makers who do not have swipe or are not in the space under the purview of another maker with swipe. 

After-hours access is defined and limited on a case-by-case basis. It is the responsibility of the person with swipe to understand the specifics of their after-hours access, and ensure themselves and all other makers they permit in are in compliance with the terms of this access.

Such after-hours access is issued solely at the discretion of the makerspace director, and can be revoked at any time. 

## Disciplinary Action

Violating any makerspace policy may result in disciplinary action. 

The following actions may be taken at the discretion of staff;

* Revoke equipment approval
* Temporarily banning the maker from the makerspace

The following actions may be taken at the discretion of the makerspace director;

* Permanently banning the maker from the makerspace, or all makerspaces.
* Requesting monetary compensation for damaged equipment, tools, resources, etc.
* Notifying a student or faculty's home college of misconduct.
* Referring misconduct to the relevant university authorities. 

## Policy Exemptions

If judged to be for the benefit of RIT, the makerspace, or the common good, the makerspace director may temporarily or permanently exempt a person, group, and/or project from any or all makerspace policies, as permitted within compliance of university policy and any applicable law.
