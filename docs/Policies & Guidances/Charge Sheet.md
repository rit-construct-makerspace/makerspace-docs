# SHED Makerspace Rate Sheet

The makerspace provides the tools and experience to help the RIT community create. There are processes that have a consumable cost which are captured below. These rates are only used to recover the material, not the aggregate cost of service.

Key:

* Free* = Students required to be involved in the process, including being present during the process to understand how their parts are being created to become better engineers, designers, ect.
* MNP = Material Not Provided
