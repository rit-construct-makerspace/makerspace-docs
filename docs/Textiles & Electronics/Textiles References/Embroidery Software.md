# Embroidery Software

A license seat for Bernina Designer Plus 9 can be found on the computer between the E16 and 590. We suggest using this version of the software for all embroidery work you do in the SHED.

Although very lengthy, the Bernina Youtube Playlist on Designer Plus 9 is the best source of information to master the software. You can access it at the button below;
