# Metcal HCT2

## Use Case

Hot air stations are used to solder very small electrical components with a paste-based solder. It is also useful for removing small electrical components from a PCB.

## Operating the HCT2

1. Clear your work area of any potentially flammable materials, and ensure your soldering target is on a nonflammable surface

2. Position the HCT2 closer to you; the hand piece is on a relatively short cable.

3. Power on the device using the power button in the top right corner. The screen should illuminate.

    a. The device is now in idle mode, it will not do anything until you pick up the hand piece from its holder. Placing the hand piece back into the holder at any time will re-enter idle mode and the device immediately will begin to cool down.

4. Pick up the hand piece, and using the controls on the front panel adjust the temperature and air pressure accordingly.

    a. Higher temperature solders faster, but can prematurely dry out solder paste or lead to tombstoning components.

    b. Lower temperature ensures more consistent heating, but many electrical components do not like being hot for long.

    c. Higher airflow delivers the heat in a more directed, longer-range beam, but can also blow away liquid flux or small parts.

    d. Lower airflow is less harsh on your components, but can lead to overheating of the hand piece or too much heat in one area of your project.
