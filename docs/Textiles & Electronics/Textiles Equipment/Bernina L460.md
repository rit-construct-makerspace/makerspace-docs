# Bernina L460

<img src="..\assets\l460 hero.jpg" class="image-float-right" width=60%>

## Overview

The Bernina L460 is a Serger (aka Overlocker depending on the country). Sergers are intended to automatically cut and apply a serged edge to fabric projects. This edge prevents fraying and is more aesthetically pleasing than a traditional stitch. Sergers are commonly used on projects like quilts, bags, and pockets.

## Serged Edge Uses

<img src="..\assets\serged edge.jpg" class="image-float-left" width=30%>

A Serged edge is the perfect way to finish a project, to ensure a clean and consistent finish. The serger will trim the material fed through it to ensure it is a consistent size, and then use 4 threads to apply a complex stitch holding the two pieces of fabric together. 

Critically, one of these threads wraps around the newly-cut edge of the material, mitigating fraying and giving better form to the seam. 

Serged edges are commonly found on consumer products such as tote bags, where the bag is serged then inverted, so the tough serged edge is inside the bag, and the clean outside edge is visible.

## Usage Information

!!! note
    We do not generally change threads in the L460. We ask that you use the loaded thread, and if needed, ask a staff for assistance re-threading it.

### Presser Foot

The presser foot on the L460 operates similarly to the presser foot of a traditional sewing machine, and must be lowered before you begin work. 

The presser foot is raised and lowered with a lever on the back of the machine, above the presser foot. This is a 2-stage lever;

* To raise the presser foot, push up the presser foot lifter until it engages (1).
* Press the presser foot lifter even further (2) for an extra raise of the presser foot and to lift the tip (3) (front foot lift).

If installed, the kneelifter can be used to raise the presser foot temporarily by pushing it out, away from your body.

### Adjust Stitch Length

The upper dial on the right of the machine adjusts the spacing between stitches, from 0.8 to 4mm. This value can be adjusted while sewing or before.

### Adjust Feed Dogs

The lower dial (A) on the right of the machine adjusts the feed dogs (B)(C). Feed dogs are the components of the machine that feed material through. The L460 has 2 independent feed dogs, that can be made to run at different rates. This can help avoid unwanted puckering and wavering in the finished material. The following options are available;

* **Gathering** (Setting 2)

### Safety LED

A red LED on the front of the machine is illuminated if the machine is ever in an unsafe (non-operable) state. In this state, movement commands from the presser foot will be ignored. 

Reasons and actions:

* The looper cover is open.
    * Make sure that the looper cover is closed properly.
* The sewing table is open.
    * Make sure that the sewing table is closed properly.
* The presser foot is up
    * Make sure that the presser foot is lowered properly. Do not lift the presser foot while the machine is in operation.
* If overheating should occur, the motor will be cut off and the Safety LED will flash.
    * Switch off the machine for 10 - 15 Minutes to cool down. Afterwards sewing can be 


### Empty Cut-Off Bin

<img src="..\assets\l460 cutoffs.png" class="image-float-right" width=40%>

Before and after use, we ask that you empty the cut-off bin. This is the bin on the front of the machine that catches cut fabric. 

To remove the bin, grab the edge of it, and while applying upward pressure, pull straight out. Two small tabs on the top and 1 at the base will slide out of the machine.

To re-install the cut-off bin, align the bottom connection bar (2) with the gap in the machine (C), then pivot upwards until the upper tabs (1) click into their respective openings (A)(B). 

!!! warning
    The cut-off bin is mounted on a sliding access panel of the machine. If the access panel slides open while removing the bin, close it by lifting it back up and it will seat by sliding to the left.
