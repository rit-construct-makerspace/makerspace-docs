## Usage Information

### Editing Stitch Parameters

Many aspects of stitches can be edited to custom-fit the stitch to your application. 

Sewing maximum speed can be adjusted with the silver slider on the front of the machine. 50% or below is recommended for most applications. 

Stitch width and length can be adjusted with the 2 black dials on the front of the machine. 

* **Width** (1) increases how far left and right a stitch travels (e.g. making a zig-zag more zig-zaggy). 
* **Length** (2) adjusts the distance between repeating stitch patterns (e.g. stretching out a zig-zag to be taller). 
* The preview on the screen will adjust automatically as you turn these knobs. Precise numbers can be input on the screen (3).

Any values that are no longer at their default will turn yellow or have a yellow outline. Tapping on these resets them to default.

### Selecting Stitch Type

The 475 comes with over 100 pre-programmed stitches, broken into 6 categories;

1. Practical Stitches
2. Decorative Stitches
3. Alphanumeric Characters
4. Buttonholes
5. Quilt Stitches
6. Personal Memory (Custom Stitches)

Clicking on each option lets you see a preview of the switch.

Multiple stitches can be combined to make a custom pattern. For instance, combining multiple alphanumeric characters to write out words. To do this, press the “+” icon at the bottom of the stitch. Selecting stitches will now add them to the pattern sequentially.

## In-Person Competency Check

To demonstrate competency on the Bernina 475, makers will be asked to demonstrate the following;

* Wind a bottom bobbin using the bobbin winder
* Install, thread the bottom bobbin in the machine
* Thread the top thread from a vertical or horizontal cone
* Select a stitch pattern
* Demonstrate raising and lowering the presser foot
* Stitch a straight stitch to combine 2 pieces of material
    * Perform a lock stitch at the end of the stitch
    * Automatically cut the thread when complete

Makers may choose to do this as part of their own project, or staff will provide test materials to demonstrate competency with.
