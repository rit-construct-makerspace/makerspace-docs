# Bernina Q20

<img src="..\assets\q20 hero image.webp" class="image-float-right" width=40%>

## Overview

The Bernina Q20 is a standing quilting machine. This is similar to a sewing machine, but without feed dogs. The machine will automatically adjust the stitching speed based on how quickly you move the fabric beneath it. This allows you to free-hand complex designs.

    The table built into the Q20 is only meant to support your project. Do not lean, stand, or otherwise put a lot of weight on this surface!

## Safety Warnings

Please read all of the following before continuing;

=== "Cut & Pierce Hazard"

    Needle can move quickly, keep hands clear of needle at all times.

    Do not place hand in needle area when powered.

## Quilting Modes

The Q20 has 3 BSR (Bernina Stitch Regulator) quilting modes, in addition to a manual mode. The BSR ensures uniform stitch placement as you move your material.

### BSR1

BSR1 is the standard mode. This mode is best for patterns with many changes in direction. 

In BSR1 mode, stitches per inch and idle speed (speed at which the needle continues stitching even when the material stops) can be controlled. 

### BSR2

In BSR2 mode, the needle stops if the BSR does not detect any movement between the material and the stitch plate. The machine will immediately start moving again when it detects movement. This is ideal for patterns that may have long stops in them. Only stitches per inch can be modified in BSR2 mode. 

!!! warning
    In BSR2 mode, the machine will immediately begin stitching even if you barely move the material. Be very cautious in this mode.

### BSR3

BSR3 mode is designed for basting, or making a temporary stitch for holding material together. In this mode, you can only select between 3 SPI (stitches per inch) options. 

### Manual (MAN)

In manual mode, the BSR is switched off. The stitch length depends on how fast you move the fabric through the machine, and it will continue to stitch at a constant rate.

## Usage Information

### Top Threading

Threading the Q20 is a bit difficult, and can take some practice to get right. Watch this video for a walkthrough of threading.

### Bobbin Threading

<iframe width="560" class="image-float-right" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3-Cv6WjZNGY?si=F9A8gmJiE7jow72L" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The Q20 uses re-usable red metal bobbins, similar to a standard sewing machine. Bobbins can be wound from top thread using the bobbin winder found on the right side of the machine. 

!!! info
    For information on using the bobbin winder, see "2.7 Bobbin thread" on page 32 of the [Q20 manual](https://www.bernina.com/bernina/media/Support/Longarm_Quilting/Q_Series_Sit-Down_Models/Documents/EN/1048005_00A_04_web_manual_Q20_2020-11_EN.pdf).

The bobbin is loaded into a bobbin case, and then inserted into the base of the machine under the table. See this video for a detailed walkthrough.

### Starting/Stopping Stitch

The machine will start when the foot pedal is pressed, depending on the [BSR mode selected](#quilting-modes). Releasing the foot pedal will immediately stop the machine. 

It is recommended to keep a tail of thread behind the material that you trim off afterwards. If it is too short on the first stitch, it may back itself out.

!!! note
    If you need to manually advance the machine, there is a handwheel on the side and back of the machine. These must be pressed in to advance the machine, and otherwise free-spin.

## In-Person Competency Check

To demonstrate competency on this machine, makers must;

* Load a bobbin
* Thread the machine
* Identify which BSR mode is best for a project
* Stitch a complex shape/pattern

This can be part of their own project, or staff will provide material and a design.
