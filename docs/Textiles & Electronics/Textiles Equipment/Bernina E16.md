    <p class = "clear-float"></p>

---

### Actifeed

Actifeed is one of the most important settings on the E16, and the cause of more project issues than all other settings combined. Understanding actifeed is critical to good embroidery on the E16.

For more information on actifeed, read this reference document from Melco;

[Melco Actifeed](https://docs.melcocloud.com/articles/#!e16pro/acti-feed){:target="_blank" .md-button}

### Bobbin Threading

<iframe class="image-float-right" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VHVsK5-1THQ?si=nZDRKFKpf8f1Hrkc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The E16 uses consumable bobbins, found in a box underneath the machine. A fresh bobbin will last for approximately 30 minutes of embroidering at max speed.

Follow this video guide on how to install a new bobbin.

Keep in mind that you may run out of bobbin thread mid-embroidery. If that happens;

* Trim the top thread with the auto cutter
* Remove your hoop from the machine
* Replace the bobbin
* Re-install the hoop
* You may need to skip back a few threads to get anything that was missed

<p class = "clear-float"></p>

### Top Threading

<iframe class="image-float-right" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3XOMpTJdYCU?si=FLVv3T2ruD3cF-FQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The top thread on the E16 is kept on very large cones that will generally last for a year of use, so it is rare to have to replace them. However, many issues result in the top thread partially unthreading itself.

If this happens, follow the video on the right on how to thread the top thread.

As a reminder, the colors on the E16 **CANNOT** be changed, and must stay as-loaded.

<p class = "clear-float"></p>

### Hooping Flat Medium

<iframe class="image-float-right" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q1Q4TpDWB78?si=GOEWUv6Y0Z8ioSsT" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

When working with flat medium, interfacing material is extremely important. Interfacing gives your material rigidity, and ensures the proper formation of embroidery stitches. The SHED stocks heat-transfer (iron-on) interfacing, as well as tear-away that is attached with adhesive spray. Cut the interfacing to be larger than both your design and the hoop you intend to use.

The *hoop* is the tool used to secure your workpiece in the embroidery machine. It is removable from the machine and indexes, meaning it is safe to remove and re-install the hoop mid-job without losing position. The E16 uses 2 different styles of hoops; magnetic and screw-lock.

**Magnetic** hoops are generally square and are made of distinct white and blue plastic. These are comprised of two parts that secure together with extremely strong magnets. Simply separate the two parts, pull your material taught between them, and the let the magnets re-attach. The upper hoop, the one with the metal arms, should be on top.

The magnets are keyed, and will only go together one way. We recommend closing one side of the magnets first, then pulling the material as you let the other 3 connect. 

<p class = "clear-float"></p>

!!! danger
    The magnets on these hoops are **EXTREMELY STRONG** and snap back together with violent force! Keep fingers clear as you close them, and use only designated manipulation dogs on the hoop to grab by.

<img src="..\assets\e16 hooping.png" class="image-float-right" width=50%>

**Screw-Lock** hoops are generally used on smaller designs. They are comprised of a bottom ring with a screw on it, and a top hoop with a matching ring shape. To use a screw-lock hoop;

1. Choose a hoop that is larger than your design but smaller than your interfacing and material
2. Place the outer ring underneath your material, with the screw loosened
3. Place the top hoop over your material, so it lines up with the bottom ring
4. Press down on the hoop so it goes into the bottom right, and tighten the screw to secure the material.

!!! note
    If your material is secured properly, it should be taught like a drum

You are now set to load your hoop into the machine. The process for this is the same for both hoop styles.

5. Position the hoop fingers (exposed metal) in the hoop arms, under the tabs on **both sides**. 
    * Push back until you hear a click of the tab locking.
    * Make sure only the material you want to embroider is between the hoop and the bobbin case. Anything else should be below the bobbin case.
    * To remove, lift both tabs and pull straight out. 

<p class = "clear-float"></p>

### Preparing the Machine for Embroidery

Once you have hooped and loaded your material, and loaded your embroidery file (see [Embroidery Software](../Textiles%20References/Embroidery%20Software.md)), it is time to prepare the machine for embroidery.

<img src="..\assets\e16 prep.webp" class="image-float-left" width=50%>

1. Use the Hoop Selection to choose the hoop you are using.
2. Set the [Actifeed](#actifeed) Material Preset
3. Assign the proper colors to your design
    * In the Color Sequence (right of screen) menu, select each color from your design file along the bottom
    * Select the corresponding color from the thread tree you would like
    * Repeat until all colors assigned
    * If not assigned manually, the machine will try to choose the closest color.

If all this is set, you are ready to embroider! The E16 will embroider your design as-shown on the screen, in the center of the hoop. IF you do not want this, see [Aligning and Tracing](#aligning-and-transforming) below.

<p class = "clear-float"></p>

### Aligning and Transforming

<iframe class=image-float-right width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Xp-biJ_Yvw?si=mSWBIurhC4avUkbt" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

By default, the E16 will embroider your design in the center of the hoop, facing towards you standing in front of the machine. In many cases, this is not what we want. 

We can adjust the position and rotation of the design in the **Transform** menu, found on the left of the screen.

!!! note
    Unlike the 590, the E16 **cannot** scale or resize embroidery designs. If you need to change the size of your design, it must be done in software and re-exported!

You can verify the position of your design on your material using the **Trace** tool, found in the top corner of the Transform menu. The outline of the design can then be traced, or you can move the laser to arbitrary positions in the design.

For more information on using the Trace tool, see "18. Trace Design" on page 108 of the [E16 Pro User Manual](https://docs.melcocloud.com/resources/Storage/e16pro_user_manual.pdf).

### Embroidering Hats

The E16 can embroider hats using the hat attachment (or hattachment, for short). Reference the videos below on how to set up the hatacchment and hoop a hat.

<div markdown>

Tips for Embroidering Hats:

* Keep your designs small, hats do not have much space to embroider
* Hat material thick and does not resolve fine detail well, stick to simple objects
* Be mindful of where the seams of the hat are, they will be hard to embroider over.
* Thick hats do not usually need interface material.

## Common Machine Issues

Below are common issues we have with the E16, and steps to fix them.

Click on an object to expand it.

??? note "Constant bottom thread break"
    Usually caused by improperly-set [actifeed](#actifeed). Try increasing actifeed minimums.
    
    Possibly caused by improperly-threaded bobbin. [Re-load bottom bobbin](#bobbin-threading).

??? note "Top thread unthreading after every cut"
    Cuts are too close together, increase minimum distance between cuts in embroidery software.

??? note "Machine fails to complete power-on"
    Likely damage to the cutting mechanism and/or a jam stopping it from actuating.

??? note "Top thread fraying or breaking"
    Usually caused by improperly-set [actifeed](#actifeed). Try increasing actifeed minimums.

    Embroidery stitch may be too dense for loaded thread and material. 

??? note "Wavy or shifting design"
    Ensure hoop is taught and properly secured in arms

    Embroidery stitch may be too dense for loaded thread and material. 

## In-Person Competency Check

To demonstrate competency on the E16, makers will have to go through the process of embroidering a design using the machine. This includes;

* File preparation
* Loading a bobbin
* Hooping flat material
* Aligning and positioning embroidery design
* Assigning colors
* Setting actifeed

Makers can do this as part of their own project, or staff can provide a sample piece to complete.
