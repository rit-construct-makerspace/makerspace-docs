# Trak K3 KMX

<img src="..\assets\trak_kmx\mill.jpg" class="image-float-right" width=40%>

The Trak KMX K3 is a milling machine, which means it shapes metal parts by cutting away material with a spinning tool — kind of like a super-precise, heavy-duty drill press.

But unlike a regular drill, this machine can move the cutting tool (or the part it's cutting) in multiple directions — side to side, front to back, and up and down — to make complex shapes and designs.

What makes the KMX K3 special is that it’s a hybrid machine:

* You can manually operate it using handwheels and levers (like an old-school machine).

* Or you can program it using a built-in computer system (called the KMX control) to do more advanced or repetitive cuts automatically.

This makes it great for both beginners and experienced machinists — you can learn on it manually, then move into CNC (computerized) work when you're ready.

### Tool Changing

These mills are equipped with an automatic drawbar, as opposed to one you would need to wrench down to secure your collet.

1. Turn the Spindle Control to Low Gear
    * This is to increase the resistance of the spindle and minimize tool movement, lowering risk of injury
2. Raise quill to highest position
3. Turn quill lock to clamp on quill
4. Holding the tool and collet securely near the shank, press the In button
    * The drawbar should engage the collet and pull the tool up
    * You should only need to hold the button for 1-3 seconds

If the tool doesn't engage, there may be a few things to check for first:

- [ ] With the collet removed, can you feel a small grub screw a few inches inside of the spindle?
    * If not, this machine will need to be repaired by Makerspace Staff
- [ ] Is the quill in the highest position?
    * To engage the spline of the power drawbar, the quill needs to be at it's highest
    * If this doesn't correct, this will need to be repaired by Makerspace Staff

### Coolant

These machines are equipped with a minimum quantity coolant system that will mist coolant along an air stream to provide lubrication to the cutting tool. The toggle for this is located above the Quill Fine Adjust Knob.

On the right side of the machine is a blue resevoir of coolant. There is a sight-glass tube on the side that indicates the coolant level. If this is low to empty, ask a Makerspace Staff to top it up.

### Spindle Speed Adjustment

!!! warning
    The spindle speed is only to be adjusted while the spindle is spinning. Failure to do so may cause damage to the machine.

This mill has a High and Low gearing to achieve different speeds and torques. Generally speaking, drilling and cutting steels will require lower speeds. When cutting softer materials, such as brass or aluminum, you will want higher speeds. Though, using smaller tools will also require faster spindle speeds. Below is a handy reference, and there are copies of this around the shop.

## In-Person Competency Check

The SHED offers workshops for in-person competency. During this workshop, you will create a 6-sided dice, taking you through a series of steps on workholding, tool selection, edge-finding, etc.

There is an option to complete this on your own, if you feel you are proficient at it. You will be supervised by a guide, there to answer any questions.
