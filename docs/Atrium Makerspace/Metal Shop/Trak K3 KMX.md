# *Trak K3 KMX

<img src="..\assets\trak_kmx\mill.jpg" class="image-float-right" width=40%>

The Trak KMX K3 is a milling machine, which means it shapes metal parts by cutting away material with a spinning tool — kind of like a super-precise, heavy-duty drill press.

But unlike a regular drill, this machine can move the cutting tool (or the part it's cutting) in multiple directions — side to side, front to back, and up and down — to make complex shapes and designs.

What makes the KMX K3 special is that it’s a hybrid machine:

* You can manually operate it using handwheels and levers (like an old-school machine).

* Or you can program it using a built-in computer system (called the KMX control) to do more advanced or repetitive cuts automatically.

This makes it great for both beginners and experienced machinists — you can learn on it manually, then move into CNC (computerized) work when you're ready.

## In-Person Competency Check

The SHED offers workshops for in-person competency. During this workshop, you will create a 6-sided dice, taking you through a series of steps on workholding, tool selection, edge-finding, etc.

There is an option to complete this on your own, if you feel you are proficient at it. You will be supervised by a guide, there to answer any questions.
