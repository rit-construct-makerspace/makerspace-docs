# Trak TRL 1440EX

<img src="..\assets\trak_1440\lathe.png" class="image-float-right" width=40%>

The Trak TRL 1440EX is a lathe, meant for shaping round stock into round features. These machines only have 2 axis of movement: X and Z.

The tools are loaded on to a tool post and don't spin - the material does with the tool feeding into it.

This machine has manual movement using handwheels, but also has the capability for autonomous movement, called Conversational.

## Safety Notices

!!! note
    **PLEASE READ ALL SAFETY NOTICES BEFORE CONTINUING**

=== "Cut Hazard"
    <img src="..\assets\cut_hazard.webp" class="image-float-right" width=30%>

    Don't put your hand or fingers near the stock during operation.

    Sharp edges left by tools can cause injury. Deburr stock accordingly.

    Do not grab chips with hands. Use pliers or sweep away with a chip brush.

    <p class = "clear-float"></p>

=== "Tangle Hazard"
    <img src="..\assets\tangle_hazard.webp" class="image-float-right" width=30%>

    Wear short sleeves or roll up long sleeves

    Secure loose clothing

    Tie up and tuck in long hair

    Remove lanyards, jewelry, gloves, etc.

    <p class = "clear-float"></p>

=== "Debris Hazard"

    Safety glasses mandatory.

## Controls

A. ACS (Access Control System)

B. DRO (Digital Read Out)

C. Gear Selectors

D. Chuck

E. Tool Post

F. Tailstock

G. Z-Axis Handwheel

H. Coolant Switch

I. Spindle Switch

J. X-Axis Handwheel

K. Axis Lubrication

### Tool Changing

<img src="..\assets\trak_1440\toolpost_1.jpg" class="image-float-right" width=30%>

A. Height Adjustment

B & C. Contact Surfaces

D. Toolpost Handle

While the Height Adjustment knob looks to be a great place to hold a tool from, the ideal tool holding form is displayed in the image. The knob hits off on surface B, and surface C is a dovetail that locks the tool holder into the tool post.

!!! note
    Surfaces making contact should be clean of debris and chips to ensure rigidity and repeatability.

Once the tool holder is in the tool post, the assembly can be locked down the the toolpost handle (D).

### Coolant

The coolant switch is on the front of the machine. There is an articulating hose for the coolant flow that can be directed towards your tooling or workpiece. Adequate coolant is great for lubrication, as well as chip evacuation. If there isn't enough coolant coming out, ask a Makerspace Staff to fill the resevoir.

### Spindle Speed Selection

<img src="..\assets\trak_1440\gear_selector.jpg" class="image-float-right" width=40%>

The lathe uses a series of intermeshing gears to change the spindle speed. Since these are gears, the spindle must **not be running** when changing speeds.

The two levers work in tandem to change speeds. The left lever has 3 positions, corresponding to different brackets of speeds. The right lever has 4 positions that move inside of those brackets.

As you are using a static tool against a dynamic diameter, your RPM can change depending on material and diameter being turned.

<p class = "clear-float"></p>

RPM can then be a calculation of SFM vs diameter.

        RPM = 4 X SFM / MATERIAL DIAMETER

Example: 2" stainless steel

        4 x 50 / 2 = 200 / 2 = 100 RPM
        Gear Selection: AII or AIII

Example: 1/2" aluminum

        4 x 300 / 0.5 = 1,200 / 0.5 = 2,400 RPM
        Gear Selection: CI

## In-Person Competency Check

The SHED offers workshops for in-person competency. During this workshop, you will create a spinning top, taking you through a series of steps on workholding, tool selection, as well as how to load and run a program.

There is an option to complete this on your own, if you feel you are proficient at it. You will be supervised by a guide, there to answer any questions.
