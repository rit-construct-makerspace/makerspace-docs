The CS-275EU is a cold saw meant for cutting longer pieces of stock to length, along with mitered cuts.

The blade is continuously coated in lubricant to keep heat down and convey chips away.

## Loading and Securing Materials
<img src="..\assets\cold_saw\vise.png" class="image-float-right" width=30%>

Material can be loaded into the vise (B) for holding.

1. Open vise using the hand wheel (A)
2. Mark a line where your cut is meant to be performed and bring the blade down to check it is in the right location.
3. Tighten to bring jaw close to material
4. Within 1/8", use the vise release lever (C) to clamp down on material.
    - Lever is a 1/2 turn lever. Straight up is fully released, straight down is clamped
    - Failure to use the lever to clamp material may result in damage to the worm shaft that moves the vise in and out


## Adjust the Miter Angle

The cold saw can make mitered cuts for welding or other fitments.

1. Loosen the miter toggle (A)
2. Pivot the head and check angle on the miter scale (B)
3. The vise jaw (C) may need to be adjusted out of the path of the blade
    - Loosen bolt (D) and slide jaw, then tighten bolt
4. Once finished, lock down miter toggle (A)

## In-Person Competency Check

1. Grab a scrap piece of metal
2. Mark a length to be cut
3. Operate the vise to clamp the material
4. Pull the trigger to begin the coolant flow
5. Bring the blade down to the material and with even pressure, pull the blade through the cut
    - The blade has a single speed / material removal rate
    - The cutting speed depends on the strength and hardness of the material being cut, along with the cross section of the material
    - Pulling harder will not make it go faster
6. Once the cut is through the material, release the trigger and bring the cutting head up
7. Use the vise release lever to open the vise and remove the material
