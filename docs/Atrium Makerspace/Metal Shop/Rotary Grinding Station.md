# Rotary Grinding Station
The rotary grinding tools in the SHED allow for precise shaping of material through grinding and sanding. These replace what a Dremel tool would normally be used for.

## Metal Shop 
There are 2 rotary grinders in the metal shop.

* Carbide Burr: Remove sharp edges/corners from metal parts.
* Cutoff Wheel: Abrasive wheel to cut any metal

**These can only be used on metals!**

## Wood Shop
There are 2 rotary grinders in the wood shop, both are sanding drums. Sanding drums are used to remove material from hard-to-reach areas of wood or plastic parts. When sanding plastic, watch for heat that may start to melt your part.

## Changing Tools, When & How

The tool type cannot be changed, but you can and should replace the cutting/sanding element yourself if it is worn or damaged. Spare consumables are at each rotary tool station.

### Cutoff Disk

We use Dremel EZ-Lock cutoff disks. These disks should be replaced if there are any cracks or irregularities in the shape. The tool will naturally get smaller with use, replace if the diameter is too small to comfortably work with.

### Carbide Burr
If the burr is clogged with material, it will not cut as well. Use a file cleaning brush to push trapped material out of the burr's teeth.

!!! note
    Carbide burrs cannot be changed by students, please speak to a member of staff if the burr appears to be damaged. 

### Sanding Drum

Sanding drums wear out quickly, replace if there is visibly missing grit, the grit is clogged with material, or if there are any tears in the sanding material. To change;

1. Loosen the small screw on the top/front of the tool. Do not remove it fully!
2. Slide the old sanding drum off the front of the tool.
3. Slide a new drum over the front of the tool, make sure to cover all the rubber of the tool holder.
4. Tighten down the front screw to secure the drum.
