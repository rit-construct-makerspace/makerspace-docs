# Laguna Tools 14CX

<img src="..\assets\band_saw\indicators.png" class="image-float-right" width=50%>
The 14CX is for cutting metal for stock preparation.

A bandsaw is a good choice for making quick cuts in thin materials, or for cutting irregular shapes in flat material. 

A bandsaw blade tends to be thinner than other options, meaning less material lost to the cut and more control over the cut geometry.

2. Positioning your material next to the blade, Use the height adjustment knob (B) to move up or down until it’s a1/8" to 
1/4” above the material
3. Once in position, turn the adjustment knob to tighten it
until it’s snug
