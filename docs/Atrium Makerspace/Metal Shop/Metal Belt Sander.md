The BD4801-M is a combination disc and belt sander. The disc and belt are 4 inches wide. Half of the disc is covered with a guard to prevent misuse.

A sander is great for cleaning up edges and removing rough material from a piece of metal.

A disc sander has a larger table and is better suited to sanding non-flat profiles (corner radii).

A belt sander has a smaller table and is better suited to sanding flat profiles.
