# JET 814GH

<img src="..\assets\horizontal\main.jpg" class="image-float-right" width=40%>
The 814GH is for cutting metal for stock preparation. This bandsaw has an auto-feed hydraulic for performing the cut, making it ideal for repeated or lengthy cuts.

A bandsaw is a good choice for making quick cuts in thin materials, or for cutting irregular shapes in flat material. 

A bandsaw blade tends to be thinner than other options, meaning less material lost to the cut and more control over the cut geometry.

## Squaring the Vise to Blade
<img src="..\assets\horizontal\adjust.png" class="image-float-right" width=30%>

1. To set up for square cutting, move the right
jaw to “B” position (Figure 10). Place a
machinist’s square on the bed against the
blade and the right vise jaw. The square
should lie along the entire length of the jaw
and blade without a gap.
2. If adjustment is necessary, slightly loosen
the front screw on the right jaw. Loosen the
hex nut at the center of the right jaw and
adjust jaw so the square lines up properly.
3. Re-tighten the hex nut and the front screw.
4. Loosen the handle (C, Figure 10) on the left
jaw. Move the left jaw until it contacts flush
with the right jaw.
5. Tighten the handle (C, Figure 10). The vise
is now set for square cuts. 

## Positioning the Vise

1. The workpiece is placed against the fixed
jaw, which has already been squared (see
“Squaring Vise to Blade”), or has been
locked at the appropriate angle (see “Miter
Cuts”).
2. The vise has a quick-release feature which
allows fast positioning of the movable jaw
against the workpiece and then a final
tightening with the handle. Lift up on the
quick release lever (D, Figure 11), then
push the movable jaw by hand until it
contacts the workpiece.
3. Push down the quick release lever (D,
Figure 11).
4. Turn the lead screw handle (E, Figure 11)
clockwise to continue the tightening process
of the movable jaw until the workpiece is
securely clamped.

5. The quick release function can also be used
to back off the movable jaw when the cut is
finished.

## Miter Cuts

1. For miter cuts, move the fixed jaw to the
inner holes, or “A” position, as shown in
Figure 10.
2. Rotate the fixed jaw to the desired angle,
and tighten the center hex nut.
NOTE: There is an angle scale on the back
side of the bed. This is for reference only.
Check angles with a protractor if greater
precision is needed.
3. Adjust the movable jaw in the manner
described above, and tighten the handle (C,
Figure 10).

## In-Person Competency Check
<img src="..\assets\horizontal\controls.png" class="image-float-right" width=30%>

1. Give machine an overall inspection. Verify
that all guards, covers, etc. are in place and
in working order, the blade is tensioned
properly and the tooth direction matches the
arrow on the bow. Check that the blade
guides are set correctly, and also the wire
brush.
2. Place workpiece in vise and tighten vise.
The workpiece should be fitted directly
between the jaws without adding other
objects.
When the workpiece to be cut is a profiled
section, flat piece or special shape, refer to
the examples shown in Figure 23 for proper
clamping positions. The top row shows
acceptable clamping positions, the bottom
row shows unacceptable positions.
    - If the thickness of the profiled section is very
thin, a piece which duplicates the profile
should be fitted inside the workpiece itself,
to prevent the workpiece being crushed
between the jaws.
    - Never hold a workpiece by
hand when cutting it – the workpiece should
be firmly secured in the vise. Do not reach
into the cutting area during cutting
operations.

3. Rotate the speed dial to the desired setting.
Do not rotate the speed dial during a
cutting operation.
4. Set a suitable downfeed rate for that
operation on the cylinder dial.
5. Push the start button to start the blade
circulating.
6. Turn on the coolant flow.
7. Open the valve on the hydraulic cylinder to
allow the bow to descend in a gradual and
controlled manner.
8. The machine will shut off at the completion
of the cut. Turn off the coolant flow, and
remove the workpiece.
9. Return the bow to vertical position for the
next cut.
