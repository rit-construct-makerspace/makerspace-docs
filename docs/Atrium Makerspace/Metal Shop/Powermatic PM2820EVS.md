## Adjusting the Table Height

<img src="..\assets\drill_press\table_adjust.webp" class="image-float-left" width=30%>

The table of the drill needs to be adjusted to accommodate your work, and/or to move the work closer to the drill. 

To adjust the table, first loosen the table lock (A). Then, the table crank (B) can be used to move the table up and down. 

With the lock loose, the table can also be rotated to position the part better.

When the table is in the right position, tighten the table lock (A) before drilling or securing your material.

## Adjusting Table Angle

<img src="..\assets\drill_press\table_angle_1.webp" class="image-float-right" width=30%>
To drill holes on an angle, the table can be tilted up to 45 degrees in either direction.

First, unlock the table tilt by loosening bolt (D) and handle (E). 

Tilt the table to the desired angle, as shown on the readout on top.

Re-tighten the bolt and handle.

Always check angle before you begin drilling!

## Inserting a Bit

The chuck has 3 jaws that grip the drill bit. 

(If needed) open the chuck wider by using your hand to spin the top surface.

Insert the bit with 1/8" to 1/4" of the shank exposed out of the chuck.

Hand-tighten the chuck by spinning the top surface.

Insert the chuck key into one of the holes in the chuck, and tighten the chuck further.

Remove the chuck key and spin the drill by hand to ensure the tool is centered.

## In-Person Competency Check

Once your material is secured and your tool loaded, you can start drilling.

Turn on the drill.

If using a vise or similar, hold it with your left hand. 

Place your right hand on the feed handle (right).

Move the feed handle towards you to drop the drill bit into the material, until it makes contact

“Peck drill” by moving the drill in a bit, then back out, to clear the chips as you go.

Apply steady pressure to the feed handle, significant force should not be required.

Once through, retract the drill fully before turning off.

**If the part begins to wobble, or the drill picks up the material, immediately power down the drill!**
