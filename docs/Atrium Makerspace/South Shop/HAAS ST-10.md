## Requirements for Use

Due to the advanced nature of this equipment, there isn't a simple process for use. The SHED Makerspace isn't a job shop, where materials can be dropped off and cut. We request that the user puts in the effort to learn how to use the equipment, along with programming.

1. Prepare your model for cutting
2. Program using Autodesk Fusion
3. Submit your program to [make@rit.edu](mailto:make@rit.edu) (.f3d for Fusion)
4. Schedule a time that works best for you Mon-Fri 9-5 to meet with Professional Staff
    - Check the calendar to avoid overlaps
5. Your program gets reviewed, checked for errors, issues, etc.
6. Come in and go over the setup of the machine and we run the parts
    - You are required to be present for the duration of the cut

Once you've completed this process a few times, we can validate your account to run this without supervision. At that point you can schedule time to come in and use it at your leisure.

## Tooling

<img src="..\assets\haas_lathe\types.png" class="image-float-right" width=35%>

The SHED stocks nominally sized tooling inserts to meet various ends. We have CNMG and VNMG inserts for both steels and aluminum, along with drills and boring bars. However, we don't have everything. So, if there is something necessary to your project, we can look in to purchasing it, if we feel it would be beneficial to have.

It is a good practice to come in and discuss what you are trying to accomplish and how best to go about it.

Each insert will typically have a code on it that is ISO controlled and defines the geometry that the insert has. The first handful of digits will define the: Shape, Relief Angle, Tolerance, and Mounting / Cross Section Type. The rest of the info is related to the size of the insert and would need to correspond to the holder being used.
