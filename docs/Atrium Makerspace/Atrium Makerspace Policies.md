# Atrium Makerspace Policies

This page contains policies specific to the Atrium Makerspace. These policies apply in addition to the all-makerspace policies.

To access the all-makerspace policies, [click here](../Policies%20&%20Guidances/Makerspace%20Policies.md).

## General Space

## Wood Shop

Dust Collection is located on the wall behind the bandsaw. Blast gates are at each machine. Make sure you are using both to cut down on dust, chips, and debris. It is your responsibility to both:

* Cleaning up after yourself
* Leaving the equipment cleaner than you found it

When gluing up materials, glue joints can be cleaned with paper towel and a little bit of water, while it is still runny. Getting glue everywhere doesn't help anyone, and then when further processing the material, you can damage equipment or leave residue on flat metal surfaces.

## Metal Shop

A metal shop vacuum is inside of the metal shop and is to be used to clean up chips from machining on the mills.

When creating chips of the lathes, it is imported to clean them from the chuck, tool post, lathe bed, etc. Brush the chips down into the chip tray, which can be emptied out by Makerspace staff.

when coolant is needed for the mills or lathes, ask the Makerspace staff for more. Coolant needs to be blended before adding to the machine.

When using the bandsaws, sander, or cold saw, you are responsible for:

* Cleaning up after yourself
* Leaving the equipment cleaner than you found it
