<img src="..\assets\drill_press\drill_press.webp" class="image-float-right" width=30%>

The PM2800B is a drill press for making precise holes in wood or plastic parts.

The PM2800B can accommodate traditional twist drills, as well as Forstner bits and hole saws.

The table can be adjusted to drill holes in parts up to 40 inches tall.

## Adjusting the Table Height

<img src="..\assets\drill_press\table_adjust.webp" class="image-float-left" width=30%>

The table of the drill needs to be adjusted to accommodate your work, and/or to move the work closer to the drill. 

To adjust the table, first loosen the table lock (A). Then, the table crank (B) can be used to move the table up and down. 

With the lock loose, the table can also be rotated to position the part better.

When the table is in the right position, tighten the table lock (A) before drilling or securing your material.

## Adjusting Table Angle
<img src="..\assets\drill_press\table_angle_2.webp" class="image-float-right" width=30%>
<img src="..\assets\drill_press\table_angle_1.webp" class="image-float-right" width=30%>
To drill holes on an angle, the table can be tilted up to 45 degrees in either direction.

First, unlock the table tilt by loosening bolt (D) and handle (E). 

Tilt the table to the desired angle, as shown on the readout on top.

Re-tighten the bolt and handle.

Always check angle before you begin drilling!

## Specialty Drill Types
For holes over ¾", there are 3 main types of drills;

=== "Spade / Paddle Bit"
    <img src="..\assets\drill_press\spade_bit.webp" class="image-float-left" width=40%>

    Spade bits are the fastest option but leave the worst surface finish

    <p class = "clear-float"></p>

=== "Forstner Bit"
    <img src="..\assets\drill_press\forstner_bit.webp" class="image-float-left" width=40%>

    Forstner bits make clean, precise holes with a flat bottom, but are only available in limited sizes and tend to blow out the back of the material.

    <p class = "clear-float"></p>

=== "Hole Saw"
    <img src="..\assets\drill_press\hole_saw.webp" class="image-float-left" width=40%>

    Hole saws are the slowest option and are limited in their depth, but leave the cleanest bottom surface and can be found in any diameter.

## Inserting a Bit
<img src="..\assets\drill_press\chuck_image.webp" class="image-float-right" width=40%>

The chuck has 3 jaws that grip the drill bit. 

(If needed) open the chuck wider by using your hand to spin the top surface.

Insert the bit with 1/8" to 1/4" of the shank exposed out of the chuck.

Hand-tighten the chuck by spinning the top surface.

Insert the chuck key into one of the holes in the chuck, and tighten the chuck further.

Remove the chuck key and spin the drill by hand to ensure the tool is centered.

## Setting Depth Stops
<img src="..\assets\drill_press\depth_stop.webp" class="image-float-right" width=40%>
You can precisely control how far down the drill moves with the depth stops.

To set the depth stops, move the drill bit to the lowest position you want it to move to. Press the silver button on the top stop (F1), and slide it down to contact the depth stopper. Release the button. Fine adjustments can be made by rotating the stop.

To optionally set a maximum upper position of the drill (such as to stop it from retracting too much), repeat the above steps for the bottom stop (F2).

## Drilling Control
<img src="..\assets\drill_press\onoff.webp" class="image-float-right" width=40%>
The drill is turned on by pulling out the large red button at the front of the machine. The green light in the center of the button will indicate if the machine is unlocked and powered. Press the button in to stop the machine. Machine will not work if interlock key (A) is not present.

Above the red button are controls for the light and alignment laser.

Above both of these is the digital speed readout. This number should be around 1000RPM. If it is significantly lower or higher, notify staff. This number will decrease slightly as you drill. The number dropping too much is an indication of overpowering the drill, and a stall may be imminent.

## In-Person Competency Check
<img src="..\assets\drill_press\drilling.webp" class="image-float-right" width=40%>
Once your material is secured and your tool loaded, you can start drilling.

Turn on the drill.

If using a vise or similar, hold it with your left hand. 

Place your right hand on the feed handle (right).

Move the feed handle towards you to drop the drill bit into the material, until it makes contact

“Peck drill” by moving the drill in a bit, then back out, to clear the chips as you go.

Apply steady pressure to the feed handle, significant force should not be required.

Once through, retract the drill fully before turning off.

**If the part begins to wobble, or the drill picks up the material, immediately power down the drill!**
