# SawStop Cabinet Saw

<img src="../assets/table_saw/table_saw.png" class="image-float-right" width=40%>

The SawStop Cabinet Saw is a table saw meant for processing larger wood pieces into panels, but can do a lot more.

Many people will use it for making items such as: birdhouses, cutting boards, cabinets, boxes, etc.

The SawStop is equipped with a device that will interrupt the blade cycle to prevent injury. This can be triggered when cutting wet material, or if a metal object is hit (such as a nail). For that reason, we require material to be wanded with a metal detector prior to use. Green or wet wood should be moisture tested prior to using this equipment.

## Kickback

Kickback is a name for when a piece of material is pinched between the blade and the fence, causing it to be shot backwards towards the user.

This happens about when the material has passed the midpoint of the blade. Using a push stick and holding the material against the fence can reduce the risk of kickback.

The user should always be to the left or right on the fence, furthest away from their material.

## Operation

### On/Off Switch Box
<img src="../assets/table_saw/controls.png" class="image-float-right" width=30%>

The tablesaw has a two-step switch for turning on the machine. The Start/Stop must be depressed before flipping the main power switch. Wait until the Red and Green lights are at a solid green before pulling the Start/Stop Paddle.

The blade should only be 1/8 to 1/4 inch above the material. Before turning on the blade, it is a good time to dial this height in.

When cutting thin strips between the fence and blade, you can use a push stick to keep your fingers away from the blade.

### Height Adjustment

The blade should always be lowered out of the way when not in use.

Before use, the blade should be raised to between 1/8 and 1/4 inches above the material.

To raise and lower the blade:

1. Loosen the Elevation Lock Knob
2. Crank the Elevation Handwheel
3. Once the desired height has been achieved, tighten the Elevation Lock Knob

### Angle Adjustment

The angle of the tablesaw blade can be adjusted. This allows for beveled or mitered cuts to be completed.

To adjust the angle of the blade:

1. Loosen the Tilt Lock Knob
2. Crank the Tilt Handwheel
3. Once the desired angled has been achieved, tighten the Tilt Lock Knob
    - Makerspace Staff have magnetic angle finders to more precisely dial the angle
