# Laguna Tools 186BX
<img src="..\assets\band_saw\indicators.png" class="image-float-right" width=50%>
The 186BX is for cutting non-metal flat material, such as wood or plastic.

A bandsaw is a good choice for making quick cuts in thin materials, or for cutting irregular shapes in flat material. 

A bandsaw blade tends to be thinner than other options, meaning less material lost to the cut and more control over the cut geometry.

The band saw is driven by large wheels. Upon stopping the machine, a foot brake is available to reduce the speed of the blade.

## Loading and Securing Materials

material through the cut

pushed through with a push stick
* Do not cut anything smaller than 4” in length

The blade guard helps to prevent contact with the exposed
blade. Use it every time.

1. Loosen the lock knob slightly
2. Positioning your material next to the blade, Use your hand
to push the upper guide assembly up or down until it’s a
1/4” above the material
3. Once in position, turn the adjustment knob to tighten it
until it’s snug

1. The fence helps to guide straight and consistent cuts
2. Turn the knob counter clockwise to loosen the fence
3. Move the fence to create the width needed or remove to
make curved and freehand cuts
    - To remove the fence, slide it off the edge of the table
    - If removing the fence, set it down somewhere safe
nearby (NOT on the floor) and always put it back on
when done
4. Tighten the knob clockwise to secure it in place
