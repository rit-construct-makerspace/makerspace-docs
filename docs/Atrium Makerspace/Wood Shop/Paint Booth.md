<img src="..\assets\paint_booth\paint_booth.jpg" class="image-float-right" width=30%>

The SHED Makerspace has a heated and ventilated room for painting, or when dealing with off-gassing materials.

The SHED can provide N95 particulate masks. Face seal respirators must be fit tested by EHS in order to be used, and would fall to the student, staff, or faculty that wishes to use them to secure their sign-off.

MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheets) must be provided upon request for the materials that are being used within the paint booth.

Time must be scheduled for use to avoid conflicts between other users. Time can be scheduled here:

## Controls

<img src="..\assets\paint_booth\controls.jpg" class="image-float-right" width=30%>

The Paint Booth is heated and ventilated. During cold months, it may be required to run the heat at ~80 degrees, as the ventilation pulls in ambient air from outside.

1. Turn on the Lights
2. Turn key on side to On position
3. Turn on Fan to begin ventilation
    - This process takes about 30-45 seconds
4. Turn on Burner (if necessary)
    - The temperature can be adjusted with the dial in the top-left corner

Ventilation / Room Pressure should only be adjusted by Makerspace Staff.
