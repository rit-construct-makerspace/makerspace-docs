## Operation

### Raising / Lowering

In order to keep everything contained, the router exists below a throat plate (red) and is below the table.

1. Using the spanner wrench, undo the throat plate
2. Check to make sure the table isn't in a lock state in the "Lock" hole
3. Using the hex key, raise the table by spinning clockwise

### Changing Bits

Once the table has been raised, you can see the collet and nut that hold the router bit in. This router operates similar to a dremel, where a pin holds the spindle, while a wrench can be used to loosen / tighten.

1. Remove the throat plate and raise the router
2. Index spindle to where the button stops the rotation
3. Using the other end of the spanner wrench, loosen the collet nut on the router
4. Check the shank of the new router bit against the collet
    - There is a reducer sleeve for 1/4" shanks, and we have both 1/2" and 1/4" 
5. Remove the previous bit and install the new bit
6. Holding the button, tighten the collet nut on the new bit. **DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN**
    - It should be snugged up, and then 1/8 turn to finish

## In Person Competency Check

1. Set the height of your bit
    - Test radius / form bits on scrap to dial height in
2. Set the fence to best support the work you are doing
3. Turn on machine by pulling out start button
4. Feed material from right to left with hands or push blocks holding the material firmly

Once cut is complete, turn off the machine and clean up.

!!! Note
    Despite having dust collection, the Router Table can make a mess. Be sure to always be wearing safety glasses and cleaning up after yourself.
