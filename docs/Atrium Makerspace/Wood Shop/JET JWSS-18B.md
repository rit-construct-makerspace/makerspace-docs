The scroll saw is a great tool for when it comes to cutting thin materials or needing to make complex cuts

The thin blade of a scroll saw will make quick work through soft and thin material.

The blade can also be fished through holes to make internal cuts.

The scroll saw is operated via foot pedal to control speed of the blade.

    Don't force material into blade

    Watch where fingers are relatively to blade

    Lower guard blade to rest on top of material

## Installing a Blade
<img src="..\assets\scroll_saw\blade_install_1.png" class="image-float-right" width=40%>

1. Turn off saw.
2. Insert lower blade holder into hole in side panel
for leverage, and loosen knob. See Figure 9-2.
3. Slide blade into holder deep enough to gain
sufficient clamping, but not all the way which
can result in blade being too short for sufficient
gripping by upper guide. Make sure blade teeth
point down, toward the blade holder. Tighten
blade holder knob.

!!! note
    If the blade holder set screw is backed out, turn it in with a 3mm hex wrench until it touches the tip of the knob when knob is tightened down. You may need to stabilize the blade holder with a 10mm wrench on the flats while doing this. Figure 9-2: Installing blade into holder

4. Flip tension lever (D, Figure 9-3) upward to
release guide.

5. Guide blade up through table slot and push
blade holder into lower blade chuck (E).
6. Push top end of blade into upper guide (F),
making sure it rests between the contact points
of guide set screws, and against the back stop.
7. Push down tension lever (D) to clamp blade. Do
not over-tension blade; this can result in blade
breakage or premature wear to clamping
surfaces.
8. Check that blade teeth point forward and down
toward table.

9. Try moving blade by hand to make sure it is
secure. Pluck the blade with your finger, as you
would a guitar string – it should emit a clear note
if properly tensioned.

## Arm Tilt Adjustment
<img src="..\assets\scroll_saw\arm_tilt.png" class="image-float-right" width=50%>

The table remains stationary, so the operator’s
hands can remain in the same comfortable position,
with no risk of the workpiece sliding off the table.
The arm can be tilted up to 45-degrees left or right
for beveled cuts, which are frequently used in
projects such as marquetry and intarsia. (Note:
Remove dust port to obtain full 45° tilt to left.)
Refer to Figure 9-1.

1. Loosen lock handle (A).
2. Make sure upper guard and blower nozzle
positions will not conflict with table.
3. Rotate handle (B) to desired angle. Preset
stops are available at 90°, 45°, 30° and 22.5°,
left and right. Push detent plunger (C) while
rotating handle (B) until plunger engages hole.
4. Tighten lock handle (A) and release plunger
(C).

Lock handle (A) is adjustable to prevent obstruction
when in angled position: Pull out handle and rotate
on pin, then release, making sure it reseats on pin.

## Material Hold Down Adjustment
<img src="..\assets\scroll_saw\hold_down.png" class="image-float-right" width=50%>

- Adjust material hold-down as close to workpiece as
possible without impeding workpiece movement.
- For vertical adjustment, loosen knob (H, Figure 9-7)
and slide hold-down to position. Tighten knob.
- For forward/back movement and angling to table,
loosen socket head screw (J) and adjust. Tighten
screw.

!!! note
    If the blade breaks, get a Maker Mentor or Staff to replace it for you.
