The scroll saw is a great tool for when it comes to cutting thin materials or needing to make complex cuts

The thin blade of a scroll saw will make quick work through soft and thin material.

The blade can also be fished through holes to make internal cuts.

The scroll saw is operated via foot pedal to control speed of the blade.

## Arm Tilt Adjustment
<img src="..\assets\scroll_saw\arm_tilt.png" class="image-float-right" width=50%>

The table remains stationary, so the operator’s
hands can remain in the same comfortable position,
with no risk of the workpiece sliding off the table.
The arm can be tilted up to 45-degrees left or right
for beveled cuts, which are frequently used in
projects such as marquetry and intarsia. (Note:
Remove dust port to obtain full 45° tilt to left.)
Refer to Figure 9-1.

1. Loosen lock handle (A).
2. Make sure upper guard and blower nozzle
positions will not conflict with table.
3. Rotate handle (B) to desired angle. Preset
stops are available at 90°, 45°, 30° and 22.5°,
left and right. Push detent plunger (C) while
rotating handle (B) until plunger engages hole.
4. Tighten lock handle (A) and release plunger
(C).

Lock handle (A) is adjustable to prevent obstruction
when in angled position: Pull out handle and rotate
on pin, then release, making sure it reseats on pin.

## Material Hold Down Adjustment

- Adjust material hold-down as close to workpiece as
possible without impeding workpiece movement.
- For vertical adjustment, loosen knob (H, Figure 9-7)
and slide hold-down to position. Tighten knob.
- For forward/back movement and angling to table,
loosen socket head screw (J) and adjust. Tighten
screw.
