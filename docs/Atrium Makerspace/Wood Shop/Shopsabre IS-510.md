# Shopsabre IS-510

<img src="../assets/shopsabre/shopsabre.jpg" class="image-float-right" width=40%>

The ShopSabre IS-510 is a large format CNC router. This machine takes in gcode from software such as Autodesk Fusion or vCarve to cut woods and plastics.

The bed of the machine can handle 5ft x 10ft material sheets, and has a vacuum system for holding down material.

This equipment can be reserved by appointment only.

## Requirements for Use

Due to the advanced nature of this equipment, there isn't a simple process for use. The SHED Makerspace isn't a job shop, where materials can be dropped off and cut. We request that the user puts in the effort to learn how to use the equipment, along with programming.

1. Prepare your model / vectors for cutting
2. Program using Autodesk Fusion or vCarve (available on all Makerspace classroom computers)
3. Submit your program to [make@rit.edu](mailto:make@rit.edu) (.f3d for Fusion, .crv for vCarve)
4. Schedule a time that works best for you Mon-Fri 9-5 to meet with Professional Staff
    - Check the calendar to avoid overlaps
5. Your program gets reviewed, checked for errors, issues, etc.
6. Come in and go over the setup of the machine and we run the parts
    - You are required to be present for the duration of the cut

Once you've completed this process a few times, we can validate your account to run this without supervision. At that point you can schedule time to come in and use it at your leisure.

## Tooling
<img src="..\assets\shopsabre\types.png" class="image-float-right" width=45%>
The SHED stocks nominally sized tooling of 1/8, 1/4, 3/8, and 1/2. We have different cutting geometries, as well (up-cut, down-cut, compression, 0-flute)

For depth of cut, it varies depending on the cutting geometry. For compression bits, you want to make your first pass at 1.5 x Diameter to get into the down cutting geometry. Otherwise, you should be cutting less than 1/2 of the diameter cutter. For stepover, you typically want 30-45% of the cutter diameter in wood / plastics.

Feed rate is a function of the materials SFM, diameter of the cutter, and amount of material being removed. Below is a baseline chart for nominally sized endmills. Depending on material, fixturing, etc. some of these values may need to fluctuate.
