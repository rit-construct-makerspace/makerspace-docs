# Laguna Tools PX20

<img src="../assets/planer/planer.jpg" class="image-float-right" width=40%>

The PX20 is a planer that can thickness wood up to 20 inches wide. This machine is meant for making two faces parallel.

When planing wood that has been glued up, **ALL GLUE MUST BE REMOVED FROM BOTTOM AND TOP SURFACE**

Failure to remove glue may cause damage to the machine or reduce the effectiveness of the rollers to convey the material.

## Safety Notices

=== "Debris Hazard"
    <img src="..\assets\debris_hazard.webp" class="image-float-right" width=30%>

    Safety glasses mandatory.

    Do not make any cuts smaller than 10".

    Do not cut thin, splintering material. **THIS INCLUDES PLYWOOD**

    Do not cut PVC or other frangible plastic.

    Sharp blade moving quickly, stay clear!

    Keep hands at least 6" from blade at all times

## Controls

<img src="..\assets\planer\diagram.png" class="image-float-right" width=50%>

The planer is equipped with a DRO, and Emergency Stop. Along with a feed rate adjustment, located on the right-hand side of the machine. Next to the feed rate adjustment is the table height adjustment.

There is a Limiter secured to the underside of the cutting head. This is to prevent the planer from crashing into the table. It also serves as a good relative reference for where the cutter head is in relation to the material to be processed. Typically a 1/8" gap between this block and the material will be a good starting point.

### DRO (Digital Read Out)

<img src="..\assets\planer\dro.png" class="image-float-right" width=50%>

The DRO can be set to keep track of how much material has been removed, as well as a good indicator for when you are making a light over heavy pass.

The DRO is timed to the Table Height Adjustment, but won't automatically raise.

1. Turn on the DRO
2. Make skim pass on material
3. Set DRO to INC Mode
4. Negative values in the DRO means you are removing material, Positive is moving the cutter away from material

### Feed Rate Adjustment

<img src="..\assets\planer\feedrate.png" class="image-float-right" width=40%>

The Feed Rate Adjustment knob can only be moved when the machine is running. Otherwise, it may cause damage to the machine.

The knob has 3 states:

- 16 Feet Per Minute
- Neutral
- 28 Feet Per Minte

Faster may be better for thinner passes, and slower should produce a better surface finish.

## Troubleshooting

### "Raised Grain"

- This can be caused by either dull inserts or taking too aggressive of a cut. Reduce pass depth.
- Dull inserts are to be replaced by Makerspace Staff only.


### "Snipe"
<img src="..\assets\planer\snipe1.jpg" class="image-float-left" width=20%>
<img src="..\assets\planer\snipe2.jpg" class="image-float-left" width=30%>

- Snipe has to do with the engagement of the cutters before and after the roller section.
- Feeding a similar height board alongside or directly after your workpiece can help to eat the snipe.
- If the snipe continues, the rollers may need to be adjusted by Makerspace Staff.

### "Material Not Moving"
<img src="..\assets\planer\table.png" class="image-float-left" width=30%>

- Friction is the enemy. Prior to making a cut, press the E-Stop and inspect the table surface.
- Glue residue or small wood fibers can stand in the way of the material moving cleanly across the surface.
- The top assembly has a serrated feed roller before the cutter, and a smooth roller after the cutter.
- A sled can also be used to help pull material along. Placing the slide down, with the workpiece against the back rail, feeding in to the machine.

## In-Person Competency Check

<img src="..\assets\planer\competent.png" class="image-float-right" width=40%>

1. Grab a scrap piece of hard or soft wood.
2. Turn on the DRO.
3. Adjust the height of the table to around 1/8" of the Limiter.
4. Turn on the Planer.
5. Slowly feed the material in.
6. Once the material is taken, go around to the back to retrieve the material.
7. Move the table up to see how the DRO reports.
8. Take another pass.
