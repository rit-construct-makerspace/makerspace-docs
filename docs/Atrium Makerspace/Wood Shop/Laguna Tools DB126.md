<img src="..\assets\belt_sander\sander.jpg" class="image-float-right" width=30%>
The DB126 is a combination disc and belt sander. The disc is 12" wide, and the belt is 6" wide.

A sander is great for cleaning up edges and removing rough material from a piece of wood. 

A disc sander has a larger table and is better suited to sanding non-flat profiles (corner radii).

A belt sander has a smaller table and is better suited to sanding flat profiles.
