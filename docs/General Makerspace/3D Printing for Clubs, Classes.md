# 3D Printing for Clubs, Classes, & Official Functions
By default, prints you submit to 3DPrinterOS are charged to you personally. Follow the steps below to have your print billed to a class, club, or official function such as a research group. 

Before you can use the 3D Printers at the SHED, please make sure to complete the following steps:

1. Log in to make.rit.edu, and setup your account
2. Click the “3DPrinterOS” button on the left side of the screen to link your make account to 3DPrinterOS.
3. Complete the “[3D Printing Self-Serve Training](https://make.rit.edu/app/maker/training/13)” quiz on make.rit.edu to get access to the printers through 3DPrinterOS.
4. If everything worked and you passed your quiz, when you go to 3DPrinterOS, on the “Printers” page you should see multiple 3D printers.


- Don't see the printers? Contact [make@rit.edu](mailto:make@rit.edu) for help or stop by and talk to a Maker Mentor.

## 3D Printing for Classes

### Accessing the Class Workgroup
To make sure your prints for a class are not charged to you, you need to be part of your class's workgroup in 3DPrinterOS. There are two ways to be added to this workgroup, and your professor will tell you which applies to you.

Important Note: 3DPrinterOS will not limit your prints to a certain size/cost/duration/etc. (outside of the makerspace-wide limits, like an absolute maximum print time), if your professor gives you a limit it is on you to keep under that limit! 

#### Option 1: Workgroup Code

If your professor gives you a workgroup code to access the printers, first go to the “Printers” page on 3DPrinterOS. 

On the right side, next to “Add Printer”, click the “…” (3 dots) menu. 

Hit the “Add Workgroup Printers” button.

A window like below should open. Enter your code in the box, and hit “Connect to workgroup”.

<p class = "clear-float"></p>

#### Option 2: Email Auto-Add
Alternatively, you may be added to a workgroup by your professor automatically. 

It is important to note that this only works if you have logged in to 3DPrinterOS at least once before your professor adds you to the workgroup!

If your professor is adding you to the workgroup this way, and you do not see the workgroup items in your account, please contact [make@rit.edu](mailto:make@rit.edu).

### Submitting your Class Print
Once you are in the workgroup, it is time to start a print! There are two types of class prints; Self-Serve and Full-Service. Some classes are set up for both, but most are just one or the other. Your professor will let you know which one you are doing, so you can follow the proper steps below. 

### Self-Serve Class Prints

Self-Serve prints are ones that you prepare yourself and are printed in the first-floor makerspace in PLA using FDM printers. 

To begin, upload and manipulate your STL like you normally would. When it is time to slice, in the “Slicing profile” dropdown, select your class name.

Once you do this, you can continue with slicing as normal. If everything worked, there should be no price on your print in the “Projects" page.

### Full-Service Class Prints

Full-Service prints are ones handled by our staff. They are generally printed on the A level of the SHED, in the Atrium makerspace.

Full-Service allows you to access both the standard FDM PLA printers, in addition to larger-format and specialty printers like SLA (resin) printers or SLS (powder) printers.

To submit a full-service print, upload your STL to 3DPrinterOS, and instead of hitting the “Slice” button on the “Projects” page, hit the “…” (3 dots) menu and select “Print” directly. 

This will bring up a collection of 3D Printers with purple icons. Choose the one that has the same name as your class and hit “Queue”.

Complete the questionnaire to select print method, quantity, etc. 

Keep an eye on your email! Staff will send you emails (via 3DPrinterOS) about the status of your print job, and/or to ask questions about it.

### 3D Printing for Clubs, Teams, & Student Organizations
Clubs, teams, and student organizations can set up a club account to send all of their prints through. The makerspace will then generate a bill for the club, that can be processed through RIT internal payment channels. 

If you are interested in setting up such an account for your club, please contact [make@rit.edu](mailto:make@rit.edu).

### 3D Printing for Official Functions (Research, Events, etc.)
If you want to 3D print for a university-sponsored function, such as making parts for research or for an on-campus event, please contact [make@rit.edu](mailto:make@rit.edu) to set up a special print account. The makerspace will need an interdepartmental chargeback number to associate with your project/function for billing purposes.
