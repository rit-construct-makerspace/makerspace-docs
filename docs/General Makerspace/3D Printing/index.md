<img src="..\assets\core one hero.jpg" class="image-float-right" width=40%>

The General Makerspace is home to the SHED's main print farm. Students, faculty, and staff can use these 3D printers for personal, club, academic, research, and entrepreneurial projects. These printers can print in single-color PLA, a corn-based bioplastic.

Makers can choose from one of the standard colors loaded in the farm when submitting their prints. These generally include orange, black, white, grey, and seasonal rotating colors such as green, yellow, red, blue, and pink.
